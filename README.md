# Term Project: Loony Lists
Description: My final term project for my Abstract Data Types and Data Structures course. I implemented a list abstract data type using a doubly linked list of arrays where each array is a circular priority queue (list.c). My project executes 3 tasks: completion of a maze, use quick sort to sort a set of user-inputted numbers, use radix sort to sort a set of user-inputted numbers. All programs written in C using terminal and Visual Studio Code. Extra detailed instructions are in the PDF file.
